# Numerical Methods Projects

This repository contains three projects that demonstrate various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. Each project includes a PDF with the tasks, a PDF with the solutions and a Jupyter notebook with the implementation.

## Project 1: Root Finding Methods

### Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of root-finding methods including Bisection, Modified Regula Falsi, and Fixed-Point Iteration.

### Methods

-   **Bisection Method**: A numerical analysis technique for finding the root of a function within an interval.
-   **Modified Regula Falsi Method**: An improved version of the false position method for finding the root of a function.
-   **Fixed-Point Iteration Method**: A method for finding the fixed point of a function.

## Project 2: Matrix Decomposition and Eigenvalues

### Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of LU Decomposition and the Power Method for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Methods

-   **LU Decomposition**: A method for decomposing a matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices.
-   **Power Method**: An iterative method for approximating the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector.

## Project 3: Numerical Integration

### Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of numerical integration methods including Simpson's 1/3 Rule and Monte Carlo Integration.

### Methods

-   **Simpson's 1/3 Rule**: A method for numerical integration using Simpson's rule.
-   **Monte Carlo Integration**: A method for numerical integration using random sampling.
